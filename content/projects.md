## Project One — Pidchas Marketplace

A free way to sell products before they even arrive."

Not bad, right? There's always room for improvement — but it already works.

Who is this platform for?

It's designed for sellers who manufacture or source products that take time to arrive at their warehouse — typically anywhere from 14 to 45 days — before being listed on traditional e-commerce platforms.

For these sellers, our service helps generate interest and find potential customers during the shipping period, even before the products are physically available for sale.

How does it work?

Pidchas is a web-based marketplace that features upcoming products from various sellers. Buyers can discover and reserve products they're interested in — before those items officially arrive and go on sale elsewhere.

The core idea

The main goal of the platform is to give sellers a chance to start building demand and finding customers well before the actual sales process begins. It's about turning downtime (while goods are in transit) into an opportunity for early marketing and customer acquisition.
