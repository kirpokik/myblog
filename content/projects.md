## Startup — Pidchas Marketplace

**"Sell products before they even arrive."**

Pidchas is a web-based marketplace designed for **sellers** who deal with products requiring **14-45 days for delivery or manufacturing**. Our service helps them **find customers and build demand during this shipping period**, even before items are physically in stock.

**Buyers** can discover and **reserve upcoming products**, securing their interest ahead of official release on traditional platforms like OLX or Rozetka. The unique **queue system** ensures fair allocation, prioritizing early interest.

The core goal is to transform sellers' waiting time into a valuable opportunity for **early marketing and customer acquisition**.

**Project Status:** Currently in active development. **MVP release is scheduled for Summer 2025.**
