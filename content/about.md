Hi there! My name is Kostinatyn Sorokin.
This website is my personal blog where I document my journey in building MVP applications for future startups, share thoughts about my hobbies, and reflect on life in general.

You can find all posts in the [Archive](/archives), or use [Search](/search) and [Tags](/tags) to explore content by topic.

I write about whatever sparks my curiosity — it could be anything from retro gaming to programming or personal productivity. There are no strict categories here, just honest notes from the things I learn or experience.

If you’d like to get in touch — whether you have questions about my projects or just want to chat about ideas — feel free to email me at [contact@ksorok.in](mailto:contact@ksorok.in).
I'm always open to new connections, especially those that can help bring creative projects to life.

This blog is part lab notebook, part personal diary. I use it to stay accountable, reflect on progress, and hopefully help others who are walking a similar path.

My long-term goal is to launch several useful micro-products, starting from simple MVPs. Some of them might become startups, others just fun experiments.

I also enjoy writing about side hustles, parenting as a techie, and sometimes — just thoughts on life.

If you're into any of that, you're very welcome here. Let’s see where this journey takes us.
