2. Right-click on it â†’ **Properties** â†’ **Sharing** tab.
3. Click **"Shareâ€¦"** â†’ select **"Everyone"** from the dropdown â†’ click **Add**.
4. Set permission level to **Read** (or Read/Write if you want to manage files).
5. Click **Share**, then **Done**.
6. Go to **Advanced Sharingâ€¦** â†’ tick **"Share this folder"**.
7. Click **Permissions**, ensure **Everyone** has at least Read access.
8. Click **OK** and close all dialogs.

Now the folder is accessible over your local network.

### Step 2: Find Your PC's IP Address

1. Open **Command Prompt** (`Win + R`, type `cmd`, press Enter).
2. Type: ipconfig

3. Look for the line under your active connection:
Example: `IPv4 Address. . . . . . . . . . . : 192.168.1.42`

Write this IP down.

### Step 3: Access the Shared Folder via VLC on TV Box

1. Open **VLC** on your Android TV / TV box.
2. Go to **Browsing â†’ Local Network â†’ Windows Network (SMB)**.
3. Navigate through the workgroup until you see your PC.
- If VLC asks for credentials, enter:
  - **Username:** `guest` or leave blank
  - **Password:** leave blank
- If this doesnâ€™t work, use your Windows user and password.

4. Find the folder you shared (`Movies`).
5. Open and play your files!

### âœ… Tips

- VLC on Android TV caches folders â€” if the folder doesnâ€™t appear immediately, restart the app.
- Ensure both devices (TV and PC) are **connected to the same router**.
- Disable Windows Firewall temporarily if you're having access issues (or create a rule to allow SMB).

### ðŸ”’ Bonus: Securing Your Share

If youâ€™re worried about privacy:

- Avoid sharing with "Everyone" â€” instead, create a specific user and set permissions.
- Use password protection for shared folders.
- Donâ€™t connect this setup to the internet if security is a concern.
