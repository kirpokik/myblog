In a continuation of my [earlier post](/posts/how-movies-help-my-daughter-learn-french/) about how watching movies and cartoons in French helps my child improve their language skills, I ran into a problem that many language learners (and movie lovers) eventually face: **subtitle desynchronization**.

üëâ [Read the first post here: How French Movies Help My Child Learn the Language](/posts/how-movies-help-my-daughter-learn-french/)

## The Problem

Let‚Äôs take a real example ‚Äî a movie I recently bought sealed for only ‚Ç¨2: The Amazing Spider-Man 2: Rise of Electro* (2014), directed by Marc Webb.
We really enjoyed the original trilogy with Tobey Maguire, and this reboot felt like a great addition.

However, when I tried to watch it with **external subtitles**, I noticed something strange.
Even though the subtitle file said it matched a runtime of *2h 21min*, the subtitles were **delayed** ‚Äî the character would start speaking, and only about 1 second later would the subtitle appear.

At first, I tried fixing this using [**VLC Media Player**](https://www.videolan.org/vlc/), which I use to watch movies on my PC.
VLC includes a feature to **adjust subtitle delay**, which helps‚Ä¶ but only at the beginning. As the movie goes on, the desynchronization **grows worse**.

So I started searching for a better solution.

## Using VLSub in VLC to Download Subtitles

Luckily, VLC has a great built-in tool called **VLSub**. It allows you to search and download subtitles from **OpenSubtitles.org** without leaving VLC.

Here‚Äôs how to use it:

- Open VLC and go to:
  `Menu ‚Üí View ‚Üí VLSub`
- Enter the movie title, choose your language and version (e.g. BluRay / WEB-DL), and click **Download selection**.
- The subtitle file will be saved next to your movie with the same filename.

  <img src="/images/VLSub_2.png" alt="Subtitle delay example in VLC" style="max-width: 100%;">
</p>

> ‚ö†Ô∏è VLSub uses [https://www.opensubtitles.org](https://www.opensubtitles.org) ‚Äî not the `.com` version.

Sometimes it takes trying a few different subtitles before you find one that is perfectly in sync.  In my case, the third subtitle option worked flawlessly.

## Encoding Problems on Android TV Boxes

When I copied the subtitle file to my **Tanix W2 TV box** (a budget Android box under ‚Ç¨25), I faced another issue:  **The subtitles appeared as question marks (???)** on screen.

This was caused by **incorrect file encoding** ‚Äî the subtitles were likely saved in **Windows-1251**, which is common for Cyrillic subtitles but not supported everywhere.

### Solution:

I opened the subtitle file in [**Subtitle Edit**](https://github.com/SubtitleEdit/subtitleedit/releases) and re-saved it using UTF-8 (without BOM)

After that, the subtitles worked perfectly on the TV box as well.

## Key Takeaways

- Check the frame rate and runtime of your movie. Blu-ray rips often use **23.976 fps**, while some WEB-DL versions are **25 fps** ‚Äî this can cause subtitle drift.
- Use **VLSub inside VLC** to search and download subtitles from [opensubtitles.org](https://www.opensubtitles.org).
- Always try a few subtitle files if the first one doesn‚Äôt sync properly.
- If you see strange characters or question marks, convert the `.srt` file to **UTF-8 without BOM** using Subtitle Edit or a good text editor.
- Some subtitle files match specific versions of the movie ‚Äî Blu-ray, WEB-DL, etc. ‚Äî so it helps to know your source.

With a few simple tools and some patience, you can enjoy any movie in your target language with accurate, readable subtitles ‚Äî even on a budget setup.
