When starting a new project, one of the hardest and most important decisions is choosing the right tech stack. After evaluating several options, I decided to go with **Django** — and here's why.

## My Project Goals

The project is focused on [brief summary — e.g., a marketplace for pre-sale products]. It requires:

- User accounts and authentication
- Admin dashboard for content and product management
- Forms, views, models — the full web app lifecycle
- Quick launch of an MVP
- Reliable community and documentation

## Alternatives I Considered

I briefly evaluated:

- **Flask** – lightweight and flexible, but requires more setup for features like auth/admin
- **FastAPI** – great for APIs, but not the best fit for full-stack pages
- **Node.js (Express)** – powerful, but not my strongest skillset and adds frontend complexity
- **Next.js / React** – tempting, but too heavy for the current phase

## Why Django Made Sense

- 🚀 **Fast MVP development** thanks to built-in admin and ORM  
- 🔒 **Secure by default** with CSRF, authentication, and user management  
- 🧰 **Full-stack out of the box**, no need to stitch libraries together  
- 🛠️ **Huge ecosystem** (Django REST Framework, Celery, etc.)  
- 📚 **Excellent docs** and community support  

## What I Gave Up

- Performance compared to FastAPI
- More modern async-first architecture
- Slightly higher learning curve in some areas

But for my goals — shipping fast, maintaining clean architecture, and iterating on features — Django is the perfect balance.

Stay tuned for more dev logs as I continue building this project.
