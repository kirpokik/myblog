## ✍️ Where My MVP Ideas Come From

Most of my ideas are born from real problems I face — small daily annoyances, repetitive tasks, or inefficient tools. I’m not trying to reinvent the wheel; I’m trying to **build something useful enough** for me or people like me.

### I usually ask myself:

- Is this a recurring problem?
- Would I personally benefit from a solution?
- Can I build a basic version in a few days?
- Can I skip UI polish and still get the point across?

If I can say "yes" to most of these, I move forward.

## 🎯 The Goal of an MVP (for Me)

I’m not building a product. I’m building **a working concept**.

I want something that:
- Works without needing a team
- Can run locally or on cheap hosting
- Doesn't depend on a perfect UI
- Focuses on the core problem

> Speed matters more than polish.  
> Feedback matters more than features.
