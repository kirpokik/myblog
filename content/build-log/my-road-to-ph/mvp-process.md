The idea for **Pidchas** came from observing how long-distance shipping delays affect small and mid-size sellers.

Many entrepreneurs who import or manufacture products often wait **weeks** before their items arrive at the warehouse. During this time, they cannot list the products on marketplaces like OLX, Rozetka, Prom, or Allo — which means **no visibility**, **no potential clients**, and **zero momentum** until the goods are physically in stock.

What if we could flip that?

That’s where *Pidchas* comes in.

## What is Pidchas?

Pidchas is a lightweight **pre-sale marketplace** — a platform where sellers can publish their upcoming products **before they physically arrive**. While the goods are still in transit, customers can **discover** and **reserve** what they like.

It’s a free and simple way for sellers to generate interest and potential leads **during the delivery phase**. The result? Less dead time, more early traction.

## Who Is It For?

Pidchas is designed for:

- Small businesses and individual sellers who **import goods** or wait for stock to arrive.
- Sellers who list products later on traditional marketplaces (like OLX, Prom, Rozetka, etc).
- Those who want to **test product interest** before investing in full-scale listings or ads.



## How the Platform Works

The service is a **web-based marketplace** that features products from different sellers. Here's what you'll find on the homepage:

- 🔍 **Product Search Bar**
- 🔗 **Navigation Menu**
- 🔐 **Login & Registration**
- 📦 **Featured Categories**
- 🏷️ **Deals of the Week**
- 🛍️ **Top Sellers**
- 📘 **How It Works** section
- 📲 **Links to Social Media & Contact Info**

All these components are manageable from the admin dashboard.

- **Featured Categories**, **Deals of the Week**, and **Top Sellers** blocks are marked with a special `Is featured` toggle in the admin panel.
- Sellers can upload their incoming stock and update it at any point.

## Why I Built It

I saw this need personally — and from stories of other sellers around me.

It was frustrating to wait 20, 30, or even 45 days with no way to build interest. Marketplaces are great once the product is in your hands — but there's a **gap before that** which no one was solving.

Now with *Pidchas*, sellers have a way to **make the waiting time work for them**.

This is just the beginning. I'll be sharing updates as the platform grows and gets ready for Product Hunt and beyond.
